# sortingAlgorithms
An application  used to benchmark five different sorting algorithms.

For this project I will be focusing on 5 sorting algorithms, discussing and evaluating their time 
efficiency separately. The chosen algorithms include;
1. Bubble Sort
2. Merge Sort
3. Counting Sort
4. Insertion Sort
5. Selection sort

To benchmark the algorithms, I used arrays of randomly generated integers with different input sizes n and tested the effect of the input size on
the running time of each algorithm.
